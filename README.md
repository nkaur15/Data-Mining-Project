### Abstract:
	In this project, various New York City collegesâ€™ 2020 annual security reports were analyzed to extract the 2019 crime statistics and to attempt to classify the type of institution these crimes are committed in: public, or private. Three models were built to classify the data and compared against each other in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Two models were decision trees, using Gini and entropy to decide what attributes to split on, and the third model was a KNN model using the nearest neighbor algorithm. In the end, it was determined that the decision tree using entropy was the best model for the dataset, with the decision tree using Gini being the least effective. 

 Note: To get Graphviz working make sure to have Graphviz installed in your local environment or GitHub codespace environment.
